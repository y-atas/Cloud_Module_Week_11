## Assignment: You need to create a network in CISCO packet tracer, as shown in the picture and whose properties are given below.

### Lan-1 design requirements:
1- Computer, laptop, access point and switch will be added as seen in the figure.

2- Laptops and PCs will automatically receive the IPs.

3- Lan-1 IP will be between 192.168.25.1-254.

4- Server0 will be the DHCP server and will automatically distribute all IPs. The IPs it will distribute will be between 192.168.25.20-192.168.25.40.

5- Server0 will be the DNS server and will perform IP name resolution of all laptops and PCs. It will also convert the IP domain name of the www.xyz.com website.

6- Server0 will be the HTTP server.

7- There will be a wireless network with SSID VIT1B on Lan-1, and it will provide connection with WPA2 encryption.

8- Lan-1 router connection ip will be 192.168.25.1.

9- All PCs and laptops must communicate with each other within Lan-1.

### Lan-2 design requirements:
1- Computer, laptop, access point and switch will be added as seen in the figure.

2- Laptops and PCs will automatically receive the IPs.

3- Lan-2 IP will be between 192.168.35.1-254.

4- Server1 will be the DHCP server and will distribute all IPs automatically. The IPs it will distribute will be between 192.168.35.120-192.168.35.140

5- Server1 will be the DNS server and will do the IP name resolution of all laptops and PCs. It will also convert the IP domain name of the www.krt.com website.

6- Server1 will be the HTTP server.

7- There will be a wireless network with SSID VIT2B on Lan-2, and it will provide connection with WPA2 encryption.

8- Lan-2 router connection ip will be 192.168.35.1.

9- All PCs and laptops must communicate with each other in Lan-2 and with those in Lan-1.
